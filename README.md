# Implementing Clean Architecture with .NET Core and AWS S3 Integration

## üìå About the Project

**CleanArchitecture.S3FileGateway** is a project based on **Clean Architecture** principles, designed to act as gateway for file manipulation in **AWS S3**. It provides a clean and organized abstraction to facilitate interaction with S3 without coupling business logic directly to AWS API calls.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **.NET Core / .NET 6+**

- **AWS SDK for .NET**

## üì¶ Project Structure

The project follows Clean Architecture and is divided into:

```
üìÇ CleanArchitecture.S3FileGateway
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ Application        # Business rules and use cases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ Domain             # Entities and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ Infrastructure     # External service implementations (S3, database, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ Presentation       # API or communication interface
```

## üîß Setup and Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cloning the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/flavio-santos-ti/CleanArchitecture.S3FileGateway.git
cd CleanArchitecture.S3FileGateway
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configuring AWS Credentials**

```json
{
  "AWS": {
    "AccessKey": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",

    "Region": "us-east-1",
    "BucketName": "your-bucket"
  }
}
